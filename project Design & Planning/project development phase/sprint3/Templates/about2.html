            The Internet-based recruiting platforms become a primary recruitment channel in most companies. While such platforms decrease the recruitment time and advertisement cost, they suffer from an inappropriateness of traditional information retrieval techniques like the Boolean search methods. Consequently, a vast amount of candidates missed the opportunity of recruiting. The recommender system technology aims to help users in finding items that match their personnel interests; it has a successful usage in e-commerce applications to deal with problems related to information overload efficiently. In order to improve the e-recruiting functionality, many recommender system approaches have been proposed. This article will present a survey of e-recruiting process and existing recommendation approaches for building personalized recommender systems for candidates/job matching.

           <p>Recent researches show that the increasing demands of IS  technologies  for  human  resource  management  in general  and  recruiting  processes  in  particular.  Most companies  put  the  focus  on  their  own  e-recruiting platforms as  primary recruitment channels. Job  ads are published automatically on the job portal as soon as they are  entered  into  the  system.  On  the other  hand, the applicant creates a profile to apply it for one of the listed job  positions.  The  user  profile is  stored in  the  system, letting  the  applicant  reuse  it  for  other  job position. The last functionality  gives  the  companies  possibility  to create the applicants pool. Thus, the companies achieved a uniform view  for  all  applicants‟ data in  one  candidate pool. This pool is  used by the  recruitment department to find  the  applicant  documents.  Appropriate  applicants‟ documents are  directed to  the  human  resource  depart-ments  for  more  processing. In  addition,  the  system supports  all  required communication  processes  as  well as tracks applicant status inside the application  process (Malinowski et al., 2005).  The  e-recruiting  platforms  are  usually  based  on Boolean  search  and  filtering  techniques  that  cannot sufficiently  capture  the  complexity  of a person-job fit as selection decisions  (Malinowski  et  al.,  2006).  Many literatures have  been  applied the  recommender  system concept into  the  job  problem.  Malinowski  et  al.  (2008) determined that, we must consider unary attributes such as  individual  skills, mental  abilities and  personality  that control the fit between the individual and the tasks to be accomplished,  as  well  as  the  relational  attributes  that determine  the  fit  between  the  individual  and  the upcoming  team  members.  In  this  context  literatures usually  distinguish  between (1)  person-job,  (2)  person-team and (3)  person-organization fits  (Sekiguchi, 2004). Thus,  the  recruitment  approach  must  cover  all  this aspects.  Keim  (2007)  argues  that  transferring  recom-mender  system  approach  to  search  for  persons  is  a challenging  but  promising  goal.  Therefore,  many recommendation  approaches  applied  for  matching candidates and jobs to overcome the previous challenges of  holistic e-recruiting  platform</p>
