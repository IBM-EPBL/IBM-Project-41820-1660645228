                    suitable jobs to people who are seeking a new job. We formulate this
                    recommendation problem as a supervised machine learning
                    problem. Our technique exploits all past job transitions as well as
                    the data associated with employees and institutions to predict an
                    employee’s next job transition. Dealing with the enormous amount
                    of recruiting information on the Internet, a job seeker always
                    spends hours to find useful ones. To reduce this laborious work,
                    we design and implement a recommendation system for online job
                    hunting. In this paper, we contrast user-based and item-based
                    collaborative filtering algorithm to choose a better performed one.
                    We also take background information including students’ resumes
                    and details of recruiting information into consideration, bring
                    weights of co-apply users (the users who had applied the candidate
                    jobs) and weights of student used liked jobs into their
                    recommendation algorithm.</p> </div>
